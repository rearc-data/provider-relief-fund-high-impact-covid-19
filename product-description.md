The payments form the $12 billion COVID-19 High-Impact Allocation is being distributed by the Department of Health and Human Services through the Health Resources and Services Administration to 395 hospitals who provided inpatient care for 100 or more COVID-19 patients through April 10, 2020. $2 billion of these payments was distributed to these hospitals based on their Medicare disproportionate share and uncompensated care payments.
